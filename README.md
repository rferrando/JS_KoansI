JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence.

The inspiration for this project comes from the Edgecase Ruby Koans and the book 'Javascript: The Good Parts'.

Open the file jskoans.htm in your favourite browser and make the tests pass.

The koans use the [Qunit](http://qunitjs.com/) test syntax and test runner.
